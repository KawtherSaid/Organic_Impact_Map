Disclaimer:

The data presented in this map and any accompanying factsheets, written reports, and news posts 
are intended to provide a broad overview of pesticide usage across U.S. states based on available information. 
It is important to note the following considerations and limitations when interpreting and utilizing this dataset:

Active Ingredients Only: 
The figures provided represent the amount of active ingredients in pounds per acre, 
calculated using the pounds of active ingredients per acre. 
This calculation does not take into account inactive or inert ingredients, 
some of which may have potentially harmful effects. 
The contentious nature of inert ingredients in pesticide formulations emphasizes
the need for greater transparency in this area, as advocated by organizations such as Beyond Pesticides.

High-End Application Rates: 
The dataset utilizes the higher end of pesticide application rates provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
These application rates can vary based on factors such as crop type, climate, and other variables.
While legal pesticide usage falls within the EPA's acceptable range, 
it is essential to recognize that actual application rates may differ based on specific circumstances.

Assumed Application Frequency: 
Due to a lack of precise data on the number of pesticide applications per year, 
a simplified assumption of an average of two applications per year for all pesticides was made.
In reality, some pesticides are applied more frequently than others, 
and this approximation should be considered a rough estimate rather than an exact representation of pesticide use.

Organic Farming Underrepresentation: 
Organic farming practices may be underrepresented in this dataset due to the challenges associated 
with obtaining organic certification. 
Farmers must adhere to organic principles for three years before becoming certified, 
which can discourage some from pursuing official certification. 
Additionally, it is essential to acknowledge that organic farming also employs pesticides, 
albeit non-synthetic ones, which tend to have fewer health and environmental concerns.

Incomplete USDA Organic Data: 
The USDA Organic data used in this project is incomplete, with many concealed data points. 
This necessitated the removal of such data or the use of generalized crop types 
to compensate for limitations in specific crop data. 
The limited accessibility of USDA Organic data, particularly when locked in PDF format, 
impacted the reporting of organic data.
This project highlights the need for greater transparency and accessibility in USDA data.

Underreported Data: 
The 2021 USDA data, particularly for Hawaii, may be underreported. Other states may also experience underreporting. 
For example, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation reported higher pesticide usage figures
for California in 2021 due to their more comprehensive data system. USDA data relies on self-reporting by farmers,
which may result in inherent inaccuracies across the board.

Missing Crop Data: 
Some crops, such as Alfalfa, Barley, Beans, and others, have little or no USDA data available. 
In such cases, pesticide estimations were based on crops with similar characteristics,
pest issues, growing zones, and other relevant factors. 
Additionally, the chemical application data for certain crops is limited, with some data dating back to 1999.

It is crucial to approach this dataset with an understanding of its limitations 
and the complexities of pesticide usage in agriculture. 
This project aims to shed light on conventional pesticide usage trends 
but may not capture the full spectrum of pesticide applications, including biopesticides and other natural solutions.

Furthermore, this project highlights the importance of 
transparency, accessibility, and accuracy in agricultural data reporting, 
calling for improvements in data collection and dissemination practices by relevant agencies.
